## Known Errors
No errors or deviations from the assignment specification.
(when a calculation should normally produce a double, it only does int calculations here per the explicit instructions to only do int calculations).

https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/sstream/basic_stringstream/ was used to learn about stringstream
Worked alone.

## Instructions
1. g++ *.cpp
2. ./a.out

# Application Purpose
If RPN is entered as command line argument, user can enter a calculation in Postfix notation and the result will be output. If DNA is entered as command line argument, user is prompted to enter a file name, DNA sequences are read from the file and their complements and reverse complements are output to file dnaoutput.txt
